== About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of [https://engineering.tamu.edu/etid/index.html Engineering Technology & Industrial Distribution] (ETID) at [https://www.tamu.edu/index.html Texas A&M University], where I am passionate about developing cutting-edge solutions for energy and infrastructure systems, with a special focus on power systems. \n
\n
My research focuses on developing and applying advanced analytics to model, optimize, and strengthen future energy systems under deep uncertainty â€” systems that are renewable-rich, electrified, AI-intensive, decentralized, and interdependent across electricity, hydrogen, and supply chain networks. \n
\n
Prior to my current position, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [https://www.cornell.edu/ Cornell University]. My academic journey includes earning a Ph.D. in [http://ioe.engin.umich.edu/ Industrial and Operations Engineering] from the [https://umich.edu/ University of Michigan], complemented by an M.S. in [https://lsa.umich.edu/stats Statistics]. \n
\n
I am deeply passionate about the transformative potential of my work, recognizing that power grids and energy systems form the backbone of modern society and are closely linked with every critical infrastructure. My current projects reflect this vision, spanning a diverse range of efforts to enhance the resiliency, reliability, and intelligence of future power systems.


# I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of [https://engineering.tamu.edu/etid/index.html Engineering Technology & Industrial Distribution] (ETID) at [https://www.tamu.edu/index.html Texas A&M University]. In my research, I am interested in developing data-driven frameworks under uncertainty to address the resiliency challenges of critical infrastructures, particularly power systems. My research integrates predictive and prescriptive analytics, drawing on methodologies from data science, machine learning, risk analysis, simulation, stochastic and robust optimization. My current projects include applications in a range of power system resiliency areas, including energy system dicarbonization and power outage management. Before joining ETID, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [https://www.cornell.edu/ Cornell University]. I received my Ph.D. in [http://ioe.engin.umich.edu/ Industrial and Operations Engineering] and my M.S. in [https://lsa.umich.edu/stats Statistics], both from the [https://umich.edu/ University of Michigan].
