== What I’m Working On and Thinking About

This list captures what my research group is working on, as well as ideas I’m exploring on my own or with collaborators, across different stages of progress.\n


. *Future Grid Planning under Emerging Stressors* — Developing frameworks to plan for the future power grid amid growing challenges, including renewable variability and hyperscale electricity demand from AI and data centers.

. *Spatiotemporal Weather Variability in Grid Planning* — Integrating weather-driven variability and impacts into power system planning, with a focus on renewable generation and battery storage integration.

. *Energy-Oriented Supply Chain Management* — Designing supply chain strategies that enhance electricity load management and operational flexibility in future renewable-dominated grids.

. *Hydrogen–Power Grid Integration* — Optimizing hydrogen supply chain planning jointly with electric grid expansion to enable efficient, low-carbon energy transitions.

. *Analytical Modeling and Forecasting* — Advancing renewable generation, electricity load, and price forecasting using data-driven and reinforcement learning–based analytical approaches.

. *Risk and Curtailment Assessment* — Evaluating the risks associated with renewable penetration, energy curtailment, and system reliability under uncertainty.

== What I’m Doing Outside of Work

Beyond work, I enjoy simple, grounding things—spending with my dear family, chasing my daughter around the house (her loud laugh always makes my day), staying active through yoga, Body20, or running, and baking—or sometimes just watching baking videos on social media for inspiration. I also love listening to music and diving into DIY projects or house tasks that often turn into delightful little experiments of their own.
