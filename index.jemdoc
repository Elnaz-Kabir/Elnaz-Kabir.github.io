== About Me
I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Cornell University jointly wroking with Profs [https://bee.cals.cornell.edu/people/catherine-anderson/ Lindsay Anderson], [https://bee.cals.cornell.edu/people/scott-steinschneider/ Scott Steinschneider], and [https://www.cee.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/vivek-srikrishnan Vivek Srikrishnan]. 

I received my Ph.D. degree in *Industrial and Operations Engineering* at the [http://ioe.engin.umich.edu/ Department of Industrial & Operations Engineering] of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 2021. In my Ph.D., I have been advised by Professor [https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/people/seth-guikema/ Seth D. Guikema]. 
I also earned a MSc in *Statistics* at the [https://lsa.umich.edu/stats Department of Statistics] of the University of Michigan.\n

== About My Research Interests
My research interests focus on the impacts of climate change and extreme weather events on energy systems. My current project includes studying the risks of climate change on energy systems with high penetration of renewables. My research aims to develop *data-driven frameworks under uncertainty* for /predictive/ and /prescriptive analytics/ in order to address the /resiliency challenges of critical infrastructures/.
\n \n
*Methodologies*: Data and Risk Analytics, Statistical Machine Learning Theory, Data-driven Robust and Stochastic Optimization, Predictive Modeling for Imbalanced Data, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Bayesian Modeling and Inference.  
\n \n
*Applications*: Energy Systems' Resiliency, Risk Mitigation for Critical Infrastructures (e.g., transportation, energy, and water systems), Energy Systemsâ€™ Sustainability, Disaster Operations Management, Natural Hazards.
