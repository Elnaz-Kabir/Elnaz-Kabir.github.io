<h2>Teaching Interests</h2>
<p>In addition to my love of research, I have always been passionate about teaching. 


Teaching is an integral and fascinating part of my career. During my graduate studies, I have gained teaching experience at various levels: as an instructor with full responsibility for a graduate-undergraduate course, as a teaching assistant for a wide range of applied and theoretical courses, and as a research mentor for undergraduate and graduate students.
